End user license agreement [version / date]

1)	Software: The toolbox has been developed jointly at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) by Sergey N. Makarov et al. The software is provided ‘as is’ and it is intended to be used solely for research purposes for computational modeling of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The software is NOT approved for any medical diagnostic or therapeutic applications. Neither the institutions (WPI / MGH) nor the authors (S.N. Makarov et al.) take any responsibility of the correct usage or the accuracy of the results produced by the distributed software. 

2)	General terms: The use for non-commercial academic purposes is governed by the general license terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3.0.   The use of this software package (or any component of it) for commercial applications is prohibited (without a separate written agreement). Re-distribution of the software is prohibited (without a separate written agreement).

3)	Coil models: All the coil models included are approximate and while they may or may not reflect the geometries of commercially available TMS coils, the resulting computational electromagnetic field estimates may differ from their experimental values.

4)	Head/Body models: The human head/body model that is provided as a part of the toolbox distribution has been derived from a pre-existing dataset, and its usage in the context of this toolbox must adhere to the following citation*

*Van Essen DC et al. E. The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective. NeuroImage. 2012; 62(4):2222–2231. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.018. PMID: 22366334. Online: https://db.humanconnectome.org 

5)	Citations: If using this toolbox in academic research, the following articles are to be cited in the published articles and presentations:

6)	Updates: The authors reserve the right to update the software and the license agreement without further notice. Updating to a new software version implicates that the end user is agreeing to the updated license agreement that will be included as a part of the distribution package.
